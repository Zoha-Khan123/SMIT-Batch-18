# Objective
Understand and practice how different **CSS selectors** — *type*, *class*, *ID*, *child*, *adjacent sibling*, and *general sibling* — target elements in an HTML structure.

Use only the **color** and **background-color** properties to visualize the effects.

---

## Instructions
Create the following two files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`

You will design a simple **“House Layout”** that includes three rooms:

- Living Room  
- Kitchen  
- Bedroom  

Each room will be represented using a `<div>` element.

Apply different colors using the selectors listed below.

---

## CSS Selector Tasks

### 1. Type Selector
Apply the same text color to all room names (e.g., Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom).  
**Example:** Make all text blue.

---

### 2. Class Selector
Use a class selector to set the Bedroom background color to light blue.

---

### 3. ID Selector
Use an ID selector to make the Kitchen text color orange.

---

### 4. Child Selector
Color only the direct child elements inside the House container.  
**Example:** Give them a light gray background.

---

### 5. Adjacent Sibling Selector
Select the room that appears immediately after the Living Room and give it a green background.

---

### 6. General Sibling Selector
Select all rooms that appear after the Kitchen and give them a light pink background.

---

## Goal
By completing this assignment, you will:

- Understand how selectors target elements based on structure.  
- Distinguish between class, ID, and combinator selectors.  
- Visualize how selectors affect layout styling in real-world web design.
