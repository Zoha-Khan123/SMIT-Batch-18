# CSS Position Assignments – Practical Projects

This set of practical projects will help you understand and master CSS positioning (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`) through hands-on website examples.  
Each task includes a short description, a clear goal, and a space for an example image.

### 1. Five Boxes Playground

**Task:**  
Create 5 elements (represented as colorful "cards" or "notes" for a friendly look) inside a main container (except for the 'fixed' element, which will be directly in the body for its screen relative behavior). Each element will demonstrate a different CSS position type:

- **Element A** – static (Default position in flow)  
- **Element B** – relative (Shifted slightly from its normal position)  
- **Element C** – absolute (Positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor)  
- **Element D** – fixed (Positioned relative to the viewport/screen, stays visible on scroll)  
- **Element E** – sticky (Behaves like relative until a scroll threshold, then becomes fixed)

**Goal:**  
To clearly understand and visually differentiate between static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky CSS position values, and how each affects an element's placement relative to the document flow, its parent, or the viewport.
